# ReactJS Components Project

## Task

 Implement two React components: a `ParentComponent` that renders multiple `ChildComponent`s, and a `Counter` component that increments a value each time a button is clicked.

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation and use of React components, including:
1. A `ParentComponent` that contains and renders multiple `ChildComponent`s, passing unique text props to each.
2. A `Counter` component that manages its own state, incrementing a counter value each time a button is clicked.

 Components:

- **ParentComponent**: Renders a title and three child components, each displaying unique text.
- **ChildComponent**: Receives a text prop from `ParentComponent` and displays it inside a paragraph element.
- **Counter**: Implements a stateful counter that increases by 1 on each button click, showcasing React's state and event handling.

## Installation

 Install the necessary dependencies:

    "npx create-react-app ."

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see:
    - A message from `ParentComponent` displaying: 
        ```
        I'm the parent component.
        I'm the first child component.
        I'm the second child component.
        I'm the third child component.
        ```
    - A button labeled with a number that starts at `0` and increments by `1` each time it is clicked.
