import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",

- Issues Encountered
Throughout the development process, several challenges were faced:

1. Firebase Authentication Setup: Incorrect API key initially caused authentication issues.
        Solution: Verified project setup and regenerated API keys.
2. Vite Bundle Size Warning: Large chunks of over 500 kB triggered warnings.
        Solution: Implemented dynamic imports to optimize the bundle size.
3. Image Uploads: Managing file size and formats for Firebase Storage was problematic.
        Solution: Added validation checks for file size and format before uploading.
4. React Re-Rendering: Unnecessary re-renders on the profile page and post list slowed performance.
        Solution: Used React.memo() and optimized state management.
5. Chakra UI Customization: Learning curve in adapting Chakra UI components for a custom design.
        Solution: Spent time familiarizing with the documentation to better customize components.
