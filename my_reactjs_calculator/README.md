# Welcome to My Reactjs Calculator
***

## Task
To Execute the and simulate the functionalities of a Calculator using ReactJs.

## Description
To summarise in brief we got to know what React web-apps are, React Components, Props, States and lifecycle of a React component. We also created a basic clock application using all of the following. But React is a javascript library to build flexible User Interfaces, and we have not created any so far. So it is time for us to step into the real world of React by creating a simple yet impactful project.

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.


## Installation
The installation are:
Installation of React dependencies using
"create-react-app ."
"npm install"
